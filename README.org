Imports events from iCal.app to the Emacs diary.

This repository is a “fork” of [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/raw/master/contrib/lisp/org-mac-iCal.el][org-mac-iCal.el]] which is [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-mac-iCal.html][described]] in
the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg]]. I say “fork” because the original file doesn’t appear to be
available in a repository anywhere.

I created this repository to publish my changes and keep track of issues.

The original file is copyright © 2009-2014 by Christopher Suckling. I
attempted to reach him at the email address published in the file but
did not get a reply.
